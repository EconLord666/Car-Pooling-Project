            Hi, my name is James. I am a VT student majoring in the MEng CS
            program. I have class CS 5744 User Interface Software and the class
            ends at 15:30 and another class starting at 16:00 in the Arlington
            campus every Tuesday. By no means can I be on time for the second
            class by taking a bus. Therefore, I am posting this invitation to
            see if anyone would like to carpool with me every Teusday. Do not
            hesitate to reply if you are happy to carpool with me.
          </p>

            Hi everyone, my name is Janie. I am a second-year master student
            studying in the ECE program. There is a career fair held in the
            Blackburg campus for ECE students this weekend. I am planning to gor
            to the event for job hunting. However, none of my friends are
            willing to take the time and cost to attend it. As a result, I am
            posting this invitation to see if anyone would like to carpool with
            me to the Blacksburg campus this weekend. By the way, this would be
            a round trip. Do not hesitate to leave a message if you are happy to
            carpool with me.
          </p>

            Hi guys, there is a academic conference held in the NCR campus this
            weekend. Is there anyone willing to carpool with me from Blackburg?
